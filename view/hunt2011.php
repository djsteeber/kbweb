The first week of the Super Hunt was unsuccessful.  The first couple days we had significant wind which made it difficult to hear anything or stay in the stand for that matter.  No deer were observed on the property over this four day hunt.  My guess is that when the surrounding corn fields are cut, we will see a significant increase in deer activity on our property.

Still no deer to report for these two weeks as the weather seemed to still be to warm to get the deer moving. From what I was told by the hunters on these two weeks there was nothing really to report. I do have some deer on the trail cams I will try to post but everything is still moving during the dark. Look for the week for report coming soon, there may be some more encouraging news. -- Jeff

There are several small does and a fork buck that are running the property, it is my hope that the Super Hunt hunters will lets these deer pass to help us insure the prospects for the coming years. -- Jeff

It was fairly quiet.  I hunted on Thursday afternoon, didn't go out in morning due to rain, and Friday - pretty much all day and didn't see anything.  It was a nice sunny day, so good for sitting.  Jimmy Dorr and I hunted on Saturday morning and didn't see anything.  On Saturday morning they started working in the corn field and taking the corn down.  We were hopeful...so we sat out a little early on Saturday afternoon.  Jimmy sat on Range 4 near the pond and didn't see anything.  The four days that I hunted - I sat on Range 1 in the corner where the two stands are.  Around 4ish, a small buck was in the field and eventually came into our woods - behind me.  He walked down the range trail towards me and then geared off.  I drew back but didn't get a shot.  He was not a big buck in size or rack - a medium size.  His rack was dark brown and went straight up with short tines - maybe a 6 pointer.  I wasn't discouraged not having a shot because of his size.
 
On Sunday morning, it was another beautiful day - Jimmy sat on Range 1 and didn't see anything.  He sat on Range 2 in the afternoon and didn't see anything.  Sunday morning - I spotted an 8-pointer in the field, around 6:15-6:30am, and eventually he came in behind me.  Walked over to the range trail...I drew back on him twice.  I took a shot and missed him - my arrow went under him.  He was not a massive buck in antlers, but nice - I'm guessing about the same medium size. I found my arrow.  On Sunday afternoon, about 20 minutes before sunset, a four-pointer showed up, he was about 25 yards away but over the fence line in the other property.  I watched him till it was time to climb down and head back.
<br/><br/> 
I was optimistic - with rut starting and the corn down, I was hoping we would have better luck in the latter days.  I used a scented drag and bleated.  The two bucks that came in behind me - didn't pay attention to the bleating.  None of them had seen, heard or smelled me.  Jimmy tried several calls as well and nothing worked.  We had the time change too - but didn't seem to make any difference. 
<br/><br/> 
With the corn down and rut starting to really pick up now - I wish the next team luck and happy hunting!
